to run the application

# Node Modules:

If the server does not work right, install following modules.

Go to the `./server` directory inside the main directory and run `npm init` to create package.json file.
Then do the following:

Express:

`npm install express --save`

Body-Parser:

`npm install body-parser --save`

`npm install cors --save`


## Test the Project

# Launch the server

You have to keep this running for the web app to have a functional back-end.

Press `Ctrl + C` to close the server.

# Launch the web application

Inside the main directory open another terminal and use the command:

`ng serve --open`

to open up the web application in your default browser.

Alternatively, use 

`ng serve`

and open the link

`http://localhost:4200`
